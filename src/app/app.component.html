          Hey! I'm a self-taught TS dev who specializes in Angular and Node. My career began with networking in the Charlotte NC area 
          and contributing to projects, and a friend was able to throw an opportunity my way. I spent the next couple years at a startup, Biteline, 
          moved on to a CBC subsidiary, and am now looking for my next opportunity and honing my skills. I love exploring dev content through 
          articles and videos and always enjoy learning new things, especially if I have a reason to apply it. I also have a huge passion for 
          making music, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch. If you ever want to challenge me, my discord tag is 
          <span class="dsc-tag" (click)="snackbar.open('copied!', '', { duration: 1500 })"
            matTooltip="copy?" cdkCopyToClipboard="balloonatic#8179">balloonatic#8179</span>!
          I'm always up for a fight.
        </p>
      </mat-card-content>
      <!-- couldn't get around clicking making the tooltip disappear so i gotta use a toast :( i was getting all fancy using events to change the text to "copied!" as well. oh well. -->
    </mat-card>
  </div>

<!-- 
  Trying to figure out how to animate each letter. Not sure if anime has a bug or what. docs and google
  don't shed too much light on how their selection works. document.querySelectorAll doesn't cut it,
  I should prob know why it doesn't jive with Angular bc Angular has their way of accessing DOM Elements
  but I don't know exactly why lol. Looking into ViewChild(ren) aaand i'm not sure where to start. Could I 
  grab them all with ViewChildren? Or put ViewChild on a parent element and try to loop through the children?

  ViewChildren gives you an array of ElementRefs which i think anime can't target. 
  ViewChild returns the ElementRef of the subtitle which has a 'childNodes' property, however it turns up
  undefined when i try to use it bc of some internal thing going on i don't understand bc of course. how can 
  you console.log the thing and it's undefined when you try to use it? gaaaah

  omg what a pain. I noticed it was animating my h3 but not the span. i thought it had to do with nesting but
  i tried different tags in case it didn't like span. <p> worked. then i made it display inline because i
  didn't want vertical text. it stopped working. so animejs requires display block elements to animate. 
  thank frick i found this.
