<!-- 
  Trying to figure out how to animate each letter. Not sure if anime has a bug or what. docs and google
  don't shed too much light on how their selection works. document.querySelectorAll doesn't cut it,
  I should prob know why it doesn't jive with Angular bc Angular has their way of accessing DOM Elements
  but I don't know exactly why lol. Looking into ViewChild(ren) aaand i'm not sure where to start. Could I 
  grab them all with ViewChildren? Or put ViewChild on a parent element and try to loop through the children?

  ViewChildren gives you an array of ElementRefs which i think anime can't target. 
  ViewChild returns the ElementRef of the subtitle which has a 'childNodes' property, however it turns up
  undefined when i try to use it bc of some internal thing going on i don't understand bc of course. how can 
  you console.log the thing and it's undefined when you try to use it? gaaaah

  omg what a pain. I noticed it was animating my h3 but not the span. i thought it had to do with nesting but
  i tried different tags in case it didn't like span. <p> worked. then i made it display inline because i
  didn't want vertical text. it stopped working. so animejs requires display block elements to animate. 
  thank frick i found this.
